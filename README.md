# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

#Overview-of-the-project
The porpouse of this analysis is to help Louise to understand better how theater plays crowfunded work and behave based on its launch date and expected goals. To make this happen we have filtered, recalculated, cleaned and used the data the study provide to create some relations that could help us to explain which Launch date and Goal is optimal to maximaze outcomes on this subcategory.

#Analysis-and-Challenges
Starting with the analysis it required to recalculate and convert a sort of formats and data there weren't easy to read or interpret, so we made some new columns as I show below that made it easier to begin filtering and using the data.

As I went further with the analysis I calculated new data as descriptive Statistics, graphs and ratios to find which variables are better to understand how plays behave.

Statisticals are comonly used to analyse historical data and in this case they provided good information about successful and failed campaings.
