# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

#Overview-of-the-project
The porpouse of this analysis is to help Louise to understand better how theater plays crowfunded work and behave based on its launch date and expected goals. To make this happen we have filtered, recalculated, cleaned and used the data the study provide to create some relations that could help us to explain which Launch date and Goal is optimal to maximaze outcomes on this subcategory.

#Analysis-and-Challenges
Starting with the analysis it required to recalculate and convert a sort of formats and data there weren't easy to read or interpret, so we made some new columns as I show below that made it easier to begin filtering and using the data.

As I went further with the analysis I calculated new data as descriptive Statistics, graphs and ratios to find which variables are better to understand how plays behave.

Statisticals are comonly used to analyse historical data and in this case they provided good information about successful and failed campaings.

#Results
Based on this information we can see that in the average the number succesful theater campaings are 1.5 times bigger than failed campaings, so we would say she has a prosper and succesful at crowdfunding project.

But not that fast, because if we look into the goals/pledged data we can see Louise maybe is leaving money over the table. As the graph below shows, the bigger goal Louise sets, the less probability of succesfull she has.

Also looking into the outcomes based on launch date, we can see there's some stationality in the summer months where for some reasons people is funding more.

As a conclusion. Last two graphs shows opportunities for Lucie:
1.- Funding more but smaller theater plays
2.- Funding a big theater play though several segregated campaings
3.- Stop or reduce launching campaings on month with lower succesful/failed ratios as January and launch them in summer.
